## Abstract
The proliferation of online misinformation presents a significant challenge, requiring scal- able strategies for effective mitigation. While detection methods exist, current reactive ap- proaches, like content flagging and banning, are short-term and insufficient. Additionally, ad- vancements like large language models (LLMs) exacerbate the issue by enabling large-scale creation and dissemination of misinformation. Thus, sustainable, scalable solutions that en- courage behavior change and broaden perspec- tives by persuading misinformants against their viewpoints or broadening their perspectives are needed. To this end, we propose persuasive LLM-based dialogue systems to tackle misin- formation. However, challenges arise due to the lack of suitable datasets and formal frameworks for generating persuasive responses. Inspired by existing methods for countering online hate speech, we explore adapting counter-hate re- sponse strategies for misinformation. Since misinformation and hate speech often coexist despite differing intentions, we develop classi- fiers to identify and annotate response strategies from hate-speech counter-responses for use in misinformation scenarios. Human evaluations show a 91% agreement on the applicability of these strategies to misinformation. Next, as a scalable counter-misinformation solution, we create an LLM-based argument graph frame- work that generates persuasive responses, using the strategies as control codes to adjust the style and content. Human evaluations and case stud- ies demonstrate that our framework generates expert-like responses and is 14% more engag- ing, 21% more natural, and 18% more factual than the best available alternatives.
